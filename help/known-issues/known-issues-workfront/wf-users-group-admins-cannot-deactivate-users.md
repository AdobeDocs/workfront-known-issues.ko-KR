# 사용자: 그룹 관리자가 사용자를 비활성화할 수 없음

When a group administrator attempts to deactivate a user in their home group, the user is not deactivated, and the group administrator sees the message &quot;You don&#39;t have sufficient access to perform that operation.&quot;

**해결 방법**

Uncheck the &quot;Is active&quot; setting for the user.
